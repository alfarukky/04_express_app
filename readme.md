## Overview

This Express.js application accomplishes the following objectives:

**Modularization:** It creates a separate Author Router in another file, which includes CRUD endpoints for Authors (Create, Read, Update, Delete), promoting code organization and maintainability.
**Integration:** The Author Router is linked to the main file (index.js, server.js, or app.js), ensuring proper routing and handling of author-related requests.
**Global Logger:** The application implements a global simple logger, enhancing monitoring and debugging capabilities across the entire application.
